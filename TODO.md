- Better icons for source file and class file
- What to do about $ classes
- Add stats to the JVM view?
- Remove unecessary commands from the command pallete
- All the language providers!

- Dependency Management
  - _Default JDK dependencies_
  - _Allow manually entered jar dependencies and paths_
  - _Accept dependencies and paths from other tools (Gradle, Maven)_
  - _Tree view of project jar dependencies and paths_
  - _Compiled class output on classpath_
  - Supplier of Classpath
    - To repl shells
    - To run or debug a program
    - To run or debug a test
- Run/Debug a program
- Run/Debug a test
- Find Things
  - _Find and open a dependency class or resource_
  - _Exclude things from finding_
